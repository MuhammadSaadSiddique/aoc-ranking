# Advent of Code Ranking

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/freedomofkeima/aoc-ranking/tree/master.svg?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/freedomofkeima/aoc-ranking/tree/master)

The goal is to show all non-zero score participants in one, global scoreboard.

Since AoC official scoreboard only shows Top 100 participants globally, it's hard to know your exact current rank compared to the others.
